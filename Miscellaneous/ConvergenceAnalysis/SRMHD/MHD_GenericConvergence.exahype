 *@comment@ This file is a TEMPLATE, it has variables denoted

 *@comment@ handing over to ExaHyPE. Furthermore, these lines
 *@comment@ starting with "@comment@" are removed from the
 *@comment@ generated spec file. Instead, there will be a
 *@comment@ description about the generated file in the
 *@comment@ following:
 *
 * This convergence test is using ideal Special Relativistic
 * Magnetohydrodynamics [using a Fortran kernel]?, in 2D.
 * 
 * Spec file generated at @DATE@ on machine @HOST@.
