# This is some helper script to paste the make.log and additional information
# to some paste service.
#
# Several options:
#    <command> | curl -F 'sprunge=<-' http://sprunge.us
#    <command> 2>&1 | curl -F 'f:1=<-' ix.io
#    echo just testing!  | nc termbin.com 9999
#    dmesg | curl -F "upfile=@-" https://clitxt.com
# all returning the generated URL.
#
# A more structured pastebin option are https://gist.github.com/ which can
# easily be used anonymously but with some JSON work. Advantage: Post several
# files in one git commit.
# See API at https://developer.github.com/v3/gists/#create-a-gist
# Usage from command line with the given JSON payload stored in test.json is
#    curl -X POST -d @test.json https://api.github.com/gists  --header "Content-Type:application/json"
# but requires json output parsing (eg. with jq). It's much easier to use
# eg. python here to do the submission.
#
# For the time begin, this shell script uses the plain text pastebins only.
# Feel free to extend for github if you feel the need to do so.
